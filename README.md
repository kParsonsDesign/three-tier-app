### Differences from Week 21 Project
Including HTTP POST opperations


### Week 21 Project Description
This project is a simple three-tier CRUD application. It uses [LowDB](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lowdb) as a very simple "database", [Express](https://expressjs.com/) to handle the API and [SuperAgent](https://github.com/visionmedia/superagent) to handle HTTP calls. The front-end styling is done with [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).

Additionally, [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [SuperTest](https://github.com/visionmedia/supertest#readme) are used for unit testing.
